# An input file for g09_calc_cpl_from_tq. That program allows for the coulomb
# coupling to be calculated overa range of xyz displacements, as defined here,
# using previously calculated transition charges.
# Note, all distances should be in A. They will be converted to bohr internally
# the grid spacing
